    <p>
      Simple salmon cooked under the oven's broiler with a homemade teriyaki
      glaze. I really like how well teriyaki flavor pairs with salmon but
      store-bought teriyaki sauce is so thin and doesn't stay on but runs
      underneath the fish. I came up with this homemade version that is more of
      a glaze that stays on the fish.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ¼ cups water, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds salmon fillets</li>
      <li>1 medium green onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine 1/4 cup cold water and cornstarch in a small bowl with a lid.
        Seal and shake until cornstarch has dissolved. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine remaining 1 cup water, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, and
        garlic in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce
        heat to a simmer and stir in the cornstarch mixture. Simmer until sauce
        has thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Measure out 1/2 cup of
        teriyaki glaze and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
        oven's broiler to low. Place salmon on a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush
        on all sides with teriyaki glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broil salmon for 12 minutes. Turn broiler to high. Brush reserved glaze
        over the top. Broil on high until salmon flakes easily with a fork,
        about 3 minutes. Serve garnished with green onion and sesame seeds.
      </li>
    </ol>
